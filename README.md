# Unity-GameSense-Project
Unity ver. 2019.2.6f1

The intention of this repo is to supplement the instructions and documentation listed for SteelSeries [GameSense SDK](https://github.com/SteelSeries/gamesense-sdk) and [Unity GameSense Client](https://github.com/SteelSeries/unity-gamesense-client).

unity-gamesense-client is included as a submodule of this repo, so remember to: 

`git submodule update --init --recursive` 


### Features
Here you will find example code to help you understand and utilize the Unity GameSense client in your own Unity projects. 
For more information about GameSense, visit the repo [here.](https://github.com/SteelSeries/gamesense-sdk)


Included in this repo is a simple Unity project with two scenes. 
- **GSPrefabScene** showcases the use of the GameSenseManager Prefab for handling GameSense events.
- **GSScriptedScene** mirrors the functionality of GSPrefabScene, but uses a script-only approach.
